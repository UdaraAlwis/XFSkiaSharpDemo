# XFSkiaSharpDemo
This is the demo project I did on SkiaSharp with Xamarin.Forms at Singapore Mobile Dot Net Developers meetup (http://www.meetup.com/SingaporeMobileDev/)   

So here I'm demonstrating about SkiaSharp basics, 2D Graphics programming with SkiaSharp, Drawing Shapes, Translate and Scale, handling user Interactions, Image handling, Animations rendering and so on...
